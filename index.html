	<p>I've made a lot of friends through the years of schooling, but I kept close to myself only the best ones, the ones who add value to my life. It was back in 2020 when we were selected to do 11th  grade at Aiyura Nayional High school.<br> We went there as strangers, but over the two years of our staying in Aiyura, our friendship grew, and the bond between us is too strong, even now we see one another as a family, because we believe that family is not only by blood related. You call someone your family when they cared about you, they cared about your interests and helps you achieve your goals in life.<br>That is why we call each other as family.
